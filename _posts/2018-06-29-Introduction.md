Hello! This is kind of a test post and blog.

I'm Igniuss, I probably won't spend too much time posting actual posts on this blog, but ya'know, why not.

I spend my time working on video games, or playing them!

(ðŸ˜‰ go check out __[the game I'm working on](http://steamcommunity.com/app/325420/)__ if you're interested)

So, the blog is a **huuuuuge** WIP, and will mostly be posting C# or Lua (Homebrew Patent Unkown features a Lua runtime, for user-mods) related posts.
